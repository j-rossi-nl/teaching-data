7	2019-03-23T14:37:28	For years, Malawi has faced tragic floods resulting in a great loss of lives and property.This year 56 people have died due to floods.In 2012, floods the southern districts affected over 10, 000 people and caused $3million worth of damage to households and infrastructure.In 2015, statisticians said an estimate of 1, 101, 264 people were affected, 230, 000 displaced, over 170 killed and 172 reported missing. The assessment has shown that total damage and loss was $335 million while total cost of recovery and reconstruction was $494 million.But this year, floods remain much larger in magnitude, even unprecedented as meanwhile, there are fears of further floods as the Department of Meteorology and Climate Change warns of more heavy downpours that could trigger flash floods in floods prone districts.Billions of Kwacha have been spent over the decades on flood reduction programmes in the southernmost districts but seemingly.In 2018, MK290 million was allocated to Shire River Basin Management Programme BRL to construct an 823 meter dyke along the Nkhande river in the area of Senior Chief Tengani in Nsanje. The main aim of the dyke was to protect the communities from floods the dyke was constructed substandard which would not protect the residents as intended.Later, Malawi vice president Saulos Chilima blasted Anati Jere, the engineer for poor work on the construction and called it a ‘waste of resources’.Each year, plenty of billions are allocated to monitor floods and recover damages and as well as reconstruct the flooded areas. But what does the government do to reduce floods?It appears that up to date, the areas which experience floods perpetually have not taken any precautionary acts such to diminish upcoming unexpected floods.It is very clear that the billions that have been flowing over the decades for floods relief, if they were spent appropriately, some measures that would have prevented more damages this current flood would have been less unforeseen. The government usually acts on floods once they strike but never acts before a disaster. It could have improved Malawi’s flooding warning systems enabling people to have more time to take action before the floods, potentially saving lives and property damages.The Government, with all the funds it obtains from flood relief programs, up to now hasn’t introduced very crucial schemes in flood prone areas such as constructing buildings above flood levels. Up to now, districts like Chikwawa, Phalombe, and Nsanje still build houses at below flood levels and most of their houses are poorly constructed as they are not concrete and get easily washed away.There’s a lot that Malawi Government would have done to reduce floods but it is not acting with much emphasis. Rather, the appointed authorities responsible for helping the country are too sensitive about money and they are very corrupt.There’s is no silver bullet for fighting corruption. Many countries have made significant progress curbing the behaviour, however practitioners are always on the lookout for solutions and evidence of impact.Corruption is the major key affecting the poverty line in Malawi. If the Government doesn’t take serious precautions to reduce floods, more                                                              avoidable disasters will still come.Botswana donates to Malawians affected by floods.

14	2019-04-11T03:56:19	Primary and secondary school teachers are flooding District Education Managers (DEM) offices to file complaints after being overlooked for promotion.A visit by this reporter to DEMs offices in Lilongwe saw teachers in their large numbers filling forms which have been provided with a hope that that their names would be included in the fresh list yet to be released after the first one had errors such as inclusion of deceased, retired, and resigned teachers.The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Principal Secretary, Justin Saidi, attributed the error to an electronic system with assurance that the coming clean list will have all the problems rectified and give a chance to other teachers who were left out to find their way in.One of the teachers who did not want to be named said government would have done better by promoting teachers who were employed in 1994 in their cohorts saying even though some were promoted to PT3 grades, more are still at PT4 and there is need to push those at PT3 to PT2 to create space to those coming from PT4 grade.Chitsamiro said the 1994 teachers have spent 25 years at one grade describing it as an insult saying even these promoted will retire at PT3, a clear testimony that government has to shame itself.She asked government to come up with a convincing explanation on the criteria used to select 1,549 primary and 4,719 secondary school teachers for promotions to dismiss claims which are being made that promotions coming ahead of elections are politically driven for teachers to vote for party in government.The teacher warned government that if it fails to treat the issue of promotions in the interest of all teachers who deserve promotions, it should start packing up as teachers will not give it their votes for it to rule the country up to 2024.Teachers Union of Malawi (TUM) Secretary General, Charles Kumchenga said the Union is holding discussions with government on the way forward as it has been receiving complaints relating to the promotions noting that some names of teachers are appearing twice.Civil Society Education Coalition (CSEC) Executive Director, Benedicto Kondowe, said government could have taken time to release the names of teachers promoted alleging that the whole process was rushed through.The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology last promoted 12,000 teachers in 2013 during the reign of the Peoples Party government under Dr. Joyce Banda as President barely a year to the May,20, 2014 tripartite elections and 20,210 teachers have found their way for promotions a months before the May, 21,2019 tripartite elections.US donates K3 billion for disaster relief.

But our resources are limited. Nonetheless, we believe the assistance they have received today will make a significant impact in one way or another," he explained.Duwa disclosed that his organization has so far constructed a decent house for a victim and very soon they will roll-out construction of five houses for victims whose houses were demolished in the tragedy and are living in destitute conditions.Meanwhile, the organization is calling on the corporate world and all well-wishers to assist with financial support so that they can reach out to more victims.The beneficiaries were randomly drawn from areas of Mpulura, Sawali, Matola and Chiendausiku in Balaka district.One of the beneficiaries is Elles Sangweni from Matola village.  The 56 year old widow recalls how she escaped the jaws of death on the night of 15 March, 2019. Her house collapsed as a result of raging water that made their way into her house. All her crops were washed away, leaving her hopeless and helpless.Since then, she has been living a miserable life as she has nothing to rely on for her daily survival.The visibly dejected woman said the assistance is timely and she can now see light at the end of the tunnel.“It’s like a dream come true receiving this assistance. I never anticipated this kind of gesture and especially from these young men and women. I can now afford a smile," she explained.Malawi was among the three southern African countries that were hit by cyclone Idai.

24	2019-03-08T02:22:34	The electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi (ESCOM) says Malawians should expect power cuts following heavy rains experienced in the Southern Region this week.ESCOM says the rains have deposited trash at its power station and the trash had blocked intake screens at Nkula and Kapichira Power Stations leading to a reduction in power generation.According to a statement ESCOM released together with Electricity Generation Company (EGENCO) yesterday, they were recently generating 326.5MW but the trash has resulted in a loss of about 165MW of hydro generation capacity.Currently, EGENCO can only generate 161MW from its hydropower stations which fails to meet the national demand of 276MW.“To mitigate and balance between current electricity demand and available power supply, ESCOM has managed to supply only 176MW to its customers using power from the available hydro generation from EGENCO and diesel Generation machines from AGREKKO.“ESCOM has subsequently implemented emergency load shedding in several areas across the country," the statement says.Meanwhile, EGENCO has started clearing the trash at the power stations and ESCOM hopes generation will resume as soon as the exercise is completed.From 2014 to 2018, Malawians experienced power cuts which at times lasted 18 hours a day. ESCOM blamed low water levels in the Shire River as the main reason for the blackouts. During the current rainy season, Malawi has received consistent rains and normal power supply resumed in December last year. Chikwawa floods kill six.

30	2019-03-25T09:10:15	At St Joseph’s Mission Hospital at Nguludi in Chiradzulu, village head N’nunkha is battling for her life after sustaining injuries when her house collapsed on March 7 during the incessant rains that lasted four days.The village head, real name Fanny Kazembe, from Traditional Authority (T/A) Mpama in the district, is in pain. She fractured her collar bone, right arm, foot and her back bone. She cannot sit. Her guardian, Anne Chinaima, says the chief eats while lying on the bed. Said the guardian: “It is even hard to take her to the washrooms as she is in deep pain."Chinaima recalls that the traditional leader’s condition was worse on the day she and other villagers were taken to hospital.“She was badly hurt Some of us feared for her life. We wanted to take her to Chiradzulu District Hospital, but the road was cut off before the hospital. So, we went to Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QECH)," she says.That was Friday March 8 They were discharged on Tuesday, March 14 to be treated as an outpatient However, some well-wishers took her to the mission hospital at Nguludi.In an interview, St Joseph’s Hospital administrator Sister Mercy Kanyombo said most of the injured people were referred to her establishment from Chiradzulu District Hospital for X-ray services. She said: “These people were coming in groups of tens and scores for X-ray service as this facility was not available at the district hospital. “This woman [the chief] came on her own as a victim. She was not referred here either by Chiradzulu District Hospital or QECH."On the night their house collapsed, there were eight people, including seven orphans she takes care of They all sustained injuries with one girl admitted to Qech while the others were treated as outpatients. The children are now being kept by Timotheos Foundation at Ntonda in Chiradzulu as their home is gone and their guardian in hospital. The old woman from Mpama is one of the many people injured during the floods that occurred in the country following heavy rain from March 5 to March 8. The floods caused havoc in 17 of the country’s 28 districts, injuring 370 of the 922 945 affected people and killing 56.Kazembe recounts the tragedy with pain, claiming it was napolo [flash floods] that nearly killed her and the seven children.She said: “In the midst of the heavy rains in the middle of the night, I took the children out of the house. But something inside of me told me something bad was going to happen."While outside, she recalls hearing a sound like that of an aeroplane flying above her home. The rain continued to pour heavily; hence, she decided to take the children back into the house, hoping they would be safer there from the fury of nature outside.When we visited her home in Chiradzulu North, we learnt from the people that the noise Kazembe heard was from Fafafa River whose source is Chiradzulu Mountain. But the people agree with Kazembe that it was napolo. Her house, now a rubble, was built one and a half kilometres from the mountain. After four days of incessant rain, Fafafa River burst its banks, carrying rock-ashes mixed with mud. The ‘porridge’ flowed down, covering maize fields while stray rocks from the mountain flew and rolled, hitting houses in their passage.Kazembe’s house, like several others in the village, was smashed by the rocks. She and the seven children were now being washed away by the ‘porridge’ amid the downpours. They were rolled and battered against the moving rocks before being trapped in a network of trees in the field. They were rescued the same night by some men from the neighbouring Jumbe Village who were alerted by an 18-year-old boy who managed to escape. About 992 households are affected in T/A Mpama. But the heavy rain affected all the six T/As in the district, namely Mpama, Chitera, Kadewere, Likoswe, Ntchena and Nkalo and left three children dead and scores injured. More than 28 381 have been affected. Some are seeking refuge in schools and churches.Chiradzulu district commissioner (DC) Malango Bottomani has appealed to well-wishers to assist people congested in classrooms and churches.“We need assistance in health, sanitation and food as these people are now rendered homeless and helpless," she said.The DC has since asked people in camps not to go back to their areas before the rainy season to avoid further accidents. “We need assistance in health, sanitation and food as these people are now rendered homeless and helpless," she said.The DC has since asked people in camps not to go back to their areas before the rainy season to avoid further accidents.

One of the victims, 46-year-old Nessie Kamanga, stood dejected in front of her four roofless houses, three of which she used to let out to students from Chancellor College (Chanco), a constituent college of the University of Malawi (Unima) that stands within the vicinity.Broken planks and glass in a mix of bent iron sheets littered the neighbourhood where residents were trying to salvage household properties soaked in the rains.To Kamanga, this disaster it is a matter of life and death: “I have lost my livelihood. My house and all the houses that I let out have been destroyed by the storm. I do not know where to start from."Another victim from the same location, Frank Chiwowo, had heavens to thank after surviving a storm during the night when his house’s roof was blown off.Zomba City Council public relations officer Mercy Chaluma said several buildings, including offices within the city’s central business district, were affected by the rainstorm.She said the worst hit areas were around Likangala, Chikanda and close to the Chanco campus.In Nsanje, some areas endured two nights of no electricity due to the collapse of electricity poles between Bangula and Nsanje Boma.Nsanje and Chikwawa, the twin districts in the Shire Valley, are prone to flooding due to their low lying topography.Nsanje district commissioner (DC) Reinghard Chavula, in a telephone interview yesterday, said the number of households affected in the areas of chiefs Nyachikadza, Tengani and Mlolo were yet to be compiled.But Khamula said in the area of T/A Tengani alone, 260 households were affected as roofs were blown off and flooding caused 15 injuries.He said Nkhotakota district was also affected by torrential rains and the district council was compiling data.By the end of December 2018, Dodma reported that 2 936 households were affected by disasters resulting from incessant rains.Government allocated K68.5 billion (about $94.1 million) for disaster response this year as the El Nino phenomenon—a dominant weather occurrence in the southern part of Africa this year—takes toll on a country already vulnerable to climatic challenges.

32	2019-02-12T08:17:55	The El Nino weather phenomenon the country is currently experiencing is likely going to cause incessant rains from this week that may lead to flooding in some parts of the country.A statement from the Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services (MET) released on Sunday and signed by director Jolamu Nkhokwe indicates that by end of this week, Southern areas of the country are likely to experience scattered rains which will be locally heavy over highlands due to the oscillation of Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).Reads the statement in part: “The expected rainfall events will cause localised disruption of outdoor activities with heavy rainfall episodes, causing flooding in flood-prone areas, particularly those heavily silted due to environmental degradation in combination with poor drainage systems."A number of districts, including Mwanza, Mangochi, Nsanje and Lilongwe, have already been affected by flooding since the beginning of the year.The department has, therefore, advised people to take preventive measures to avoid loss of life and property.Although El Nino is a regional phenomenon, environmental experts have said the country should step up efforts to replace lost vegetative cover, including replanting of trees and conservation of other natural resources.In the statement, Nkhokwe urged people to refrain from crossing swollen rivers, urging the public to stay indoors and avoid playing on an open ground or seeking shelters under trees, among other things.Department of Disaster Preparedness and Management Affairs (Dodma) under the Ministry of Homeland Security has been instrumental in coordinating relief efforts towards people who have been affected by floods and other climatic hazards.Dodma spokesperson Chipiliro Khamula said in an interview yesterday the department has stepped up efforts to ensure that its disaster response was swift.He said: “As a government agency responsible for the coordination of disaster response, we have ensured that all standby equipment and personnel are strategically positioned to ensure that we respond to any call in real time."Khamula said Dodma has stockpiled relief items at its main warehouse in Ntcheu and others in Blantyre and Karonga.Dodma, with support from United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), has established evacuation centres in flood-prone districts of Mangochi, Nsanje, Salima, Karonga and Chikwawa. nMET warns of more heavy rains, windstorms - The Nation Online.

I know that countries like Germany are interested in the reconstruction program. The government is doing all it can because we are not receiving any money from the donors on the resettlement program," he said.He said the government is asking those wishing to leave the camps and go back to their homes do so voluntarily.The minister said out of the K32 billion budget for the whole flood victims’ recovery program, only K7 billion was made available.The minister’s comments come barely a day after some people in Chikwawa say they will not leave their homes for upper-land unless the government gives them fertile land and implement a proper relocation plan.Village headman Machilika from Ngabu in the district told government officials that they would not allow to relocate to a barren land, leaving the fertile land although it is in disaster prone area.“We cannot abandon the fertile land. If the government is serious enough to relocate us, identify another fertile land then we will oblige," he said.District Commissioner for Chikwawa,  Lusungu Nhlane, said the government has already identified the land and is in the process of finalizing the relocation process.The flood victims also complained of lack of food in camps, lack of construction materials as well as malaria outbreak.The district commissioner said a malaria vaccine campaign will roll out in the camps next week and the government and other partners will source the other relief items needed Sharing is caring!

Our third generation is born here. So, Malawi is our home. This is not our second home anymore, this is our first home. So, when this disaster hit, we thought there is a time we should come out and help our fellow Malawians. But this is not only for the disaster, during the hold month of Ramadhan, we have been doing the same," he said.Kamdar noted that the need to assist is born out of a desire to help fellow countrymen in their time of need.“Like I said, we all are Malawians, we all are brothers. We feel for them, we feel for this communities. We feel for them because our bread and butter is here, our kids are born here. We also urge people that we should do what we can do to help our brothers and sisters," he said.The Pakistan Welfare Association was created three years ago by Malawians of Pakistan origin and, according to Kamdar, the funds for the relief items were sourced from the association’s members both in Malawi as well as friends outside the country.“We urge people to donate but also come in the field to see for themselves because that way, one feels a sense of self-fulfillment," he said.Kamdar said they chose Zomba and Phalombe after realising that the two areas seemed neglected from the areas that had been affected by the flooding.“We have done our survey and we realized that some places such as these have been neglected. We want to go where other organisations have not gone. We identified this area after we heard that no one came here to support the communities," he said.Luwiza Matembwe, an 80-year-old great-grandmother from Mwaliwa Village whose house fell with the rains, was visibly at a loss of words to describe her joy at the relief items she had received.“All my belongings went with the rain which suddenly came in the night so we had no time to rescue anything. So, this donation will at least give me a starting point because right now, I am at point zero," she said.She explained that apart from her house, her livestock as we as well as crops in her garden were washed away by the ravaging floods.On his part, Group Village Chaweza said the devastation in his area was gross.He explained that the damage was caused by the flooding Phalombe River, further stating that he has not seen such devastation since his birth.Chaweza appealed for more relief items such as tents to enable the flood victims to return to their homes to try and start all over again.“The camp is not a place to live because, like you can see, this is a school and it does not have the functionalities to handle such volumes of people.

It is a huge donation and it is coming at a time when people affected by the floods are starting to rebuild their lives again after the floods. We ask other companies to emulate a good example set by Tobacco processors Association," said Dausi.He indicated that the relief items which included food and non-food items namely rice, maize floor, kapenta, beans, likuni phala, milk, cooking oil, blankets, plastic sheets, kitchen utensils and mosquito nets would be airlifted to Chisi Island by Malawi army helicopters.After the presentation ceremony at the Zomba Airwing Base, officials from TPA, Dodma and journalists flew to the Chisi Island to appreciate how the flood victims were fairing on the ground Sharing is caring!

68	2019-03-21T14:31:06	Severe floods in Malawi have affected about a million people and claimed 56 lives.This isn’t uncommon in the country. Between 1946 and 2013, floods accounted for 48% of major disasters, and their frequency and severity is increasing. They have occurred in 16 out of the country’s 28 districts, in both rural and urban areas. The Lower Shire Valley in southern Malawi, bordering Mozambique, composed of Chikwawa and Nsanje Districts is the most flood prone and affected area.Floods stifle development efforts at every level. They affect many sectors from agriculture to sanitation, environment and education. The combined effects of floods and droughts cause losses of at least 1.7% of Malawi’s GDP annually. And due to food shortages and higher domestic prices, the national poverty headcount rate increases by almost 1% each year.One of the major reasons for floods in Malawi is rainfall characteristics. Rainfall is variable, erratic and rainfall in the highlands often causesfloods in the low-lying areas. Also, extensive deforestation increases runoff and the overall flood risk.But to understand how floods become a “disaster" we need to understand why local communities are so vulnerable in the first place. Floods, similar to other hazards, are often portrayed as “natural disasters" when their impact actually has a large amount to do with social and human vulnerability.As Phil O’Keefe, Ken Westgate and Ben Wisner – prominent scholars who shaped current academic thinking on the topic – have argued, the impact of disasters like floods is a consequence of social and economic factors. For instance, high poverty levels mean people lack access to land and work and they are often driven to settle in zones that are more exposed to natural hazards.What this suggests is that the most effective approach to managing the effects of floods is to deal with the underlying causes of vulnerability. This should include addressing particular issues that make certain community groups more vulnerable than others. Because the threat of floods can’t be eliminated, the best strategy is one that improves the overall development of local communities.In my research I investigated community-based flood-risk strategies, which are widely used in Malawi. My findings showed that although strategies are mostly responsive and focus on relief, more are starting to look at how to mitigate and prepare for floods.But a number of challenges remain. There’s not enough funding, community participation is limited, while the existing decentralised governance system isn’t effective so project planning, implementation and maintenance isn’t smooth. Projects are also unsustainable, rely heavily on aid and there’s a lack of ownership by the community which undermines the impact.Malawi is the third poorest country in the world. About half the population lives below the poverty line. Chikwawa and Nsanje, which have been particularly affected by the floods, are the poorest in the country.Over 80% of Malawians rely on agriculture. Most are smallholder farmers. With their livelihoods reliant on a single rain-fed season they are particularly vulnerable to floods. Recent research shows that smallholder farmers lose 2.67% of their agricultural produce to flooding each year.High levels of poverty, a lack of access to land and a growing populationmeans people have smaller pieces of land for farming. This has led to settlements in marginalised areas that are prone to flooding.Another factor contributing to people’s vulnerability is that housing and infrastructure are of poor quality. In addition, there’s a lack of economic diversification, employment opportunities and access to social services. This means that people are limited in how they can prepare for a possible flood and bounce back after it’s happened.To address the flood disasters the Malawian government signed a comprehensive national disaster risk policy in 2015. But delivery has been mixed.. This is mainly because of a lack of designated funding and a number of challenges in the existing governance approaches.The government has pushed for resettlement of people living in flood prone areas. But planning is ineffective and giving people land with no other support can expose them to further risks.Flood risk management is mostly delivered by NGOs who implement community-based approaches like early warning systems, search and rescue training, village contingency planning, and the establishment of group savings schemes.There have also been attempts to create a state-of-the-art national early warning system, based on the latest computer modelling and satellite products. Its effectiveness hasn’t been evaluated yet.Despite these efforts the gaps in managing the risk of floods are significant. A network of rain gauges as well as timely weather and climate information are essential components for early warning systems and planning. But both need to be improved. In addition, there’s not enough uptake by local communities of early warning information.And on top of it all there’s barely any flood protection infrastructure – like robust dikes. What does exist is of poor quality.One of the biggest problems is that there’s only limited involvement of local communities. This has led to projects not being implemented in all affected areas. And often projects reflect the donor’s agenda rather than needs on the ground.To manage flood risks more effectively Malawi needs to take some crucial steps.The first is that short-term priorities must be identified and coupled with a comprehensive long-term adaptive plan. This should also take into account the possible effects of climate change. It must provide a fine balance between physical infrastructure and improved forecasting and warning systems, among other strategies. And more comprehensive risk assessments should make use of new technologies – like remote sensing and crowd-sourcing.This must be accompanied by a well-planned financial agenda. Finally, any proposed solutions must be designed with the involvement of those most affected because they are the custodians of rich local knowledge and can provide valuable insights.—The Conversation.

Over 436,000 in 14 districts people have been affected and are either in camps or being houses by friends and family as they wait to rebuild.In her remarks, Hazel Nyathi thanked the people of Neno for their resilience and urged them to fix their eyes on the future and rebuilding their livelihoods. She further said that World Vision, beyond the food distribution, will be looking at ways to ensure that the people are supported with farm inputs for winter cropping.“Preliminary indications show this may escalate into a significant relief and recovery situation for Malawi as crop damage will push already fragile communities into food insecurity", she said.“Therefore World Vision appeals for support from partners and funding agencies to support affected households with winter cropping tools, especially those in communities that will have access to water", added Nyathi.World Vision, has been on the ground responding to floods since February when the first wave of floods displaced over 5, 000 people in Chikwawa.The organisation set up a Child Friendly centre, provided tarpaulins for temporary homes and gave 250 kilograms of HTH to the District Health Office to help with water treatment Sharing is caring!
70	2019-01-30T10:21:44	World Vision Malawi presented sheets for temporary shelters and chlorine for treating water to people in eight  villages whose homes were  washed away by flood in Chikwawa districts.The floods demolished homes and household items, as well as washed away crops and livestock. Roads and bridges have been destroye  and people’s access to clean, safe water has been affected.Evacuation centres have been set up at several primary schools, but even these relatively safe places have limited security, inadequate sanitary facilities and poor access to food and water.World Vision has on-going programmes in many of the flood-hit areas and is working to support children and their families who have been impacted.On Monday, World Vision led by Country Director, HezelNyathi visited one of the sites where thousands of people have been displaced due to floods.Nyathi said:“As World Vision we are first responders after hearing of these floods in Chikwawa. We are shocked to see thousands of people displaced and without food," she said.She said that so far they have distributed seven tins of  Chroline which will be used for water purification,  tents  and will soon be providing other items like food, as well as setting up safe spaces for children to spend time, while they’re away from home and school.With predictions of more coming typhoons  in Chikwawa, Nyathi said World Vision  is concerned about the damaged crops, livestock and livelihood caused by the flooding.She said, for instance,  InTizola Village , many families, in the flood-affected areas, live on subsistence farming and loss of agricultural crops or livestock can push already-impoverished families further into poverty and affect household food security.Group Village Headman Chikuse said the flooding began on the evening of January 25 , after five  days of heavy rain in the area  has resulted in dangerously high river and dam levels. An incident  in Shire River  resulted in flash flooding.An estimated 5000  people have been affected in 6  villages  and  were displaced.He said the homes have been inundated with water; school closed, and some maize fields  destroyed.“Families are travelling by boat,  instead of road. This has long-term social-economic impacts as it disrupts the livelihoods and well-being of the local communities," he said.Emergency shelters are currently overcrowded and space management will be essential to allow the set-up of key infrastructure. Measures are being taken to prevent disease outbreaks.World Vision continues to work with the Government  and other  development partners like Red Cross to provide essential support and services to the affected population Sharing is caring!

Here we are now with a disaster on our hands, as we are still singing the same song (warning).“People should start listening to the city councils when told not to build houses in disaster-prone areas.

87	2019-03-14T05:48:54	Chiradzulu District was not spared from the incessant heavy rains that hit southern Malawi last week and members of a charity Trust Fund from Chiradzulu West mobilized themselves to assist over a hundred households with relief items on Wednesday.The groupings treasurer Evelyn Mwapasa said initially the Trust Fund caters for paying school fees to underprivileged people from the area but after the heavy rains that affected thousands of households in the Southern Region, they asked the area’s Community Development Committee (CDC) to make some damage assessment, especially for homes who are beneficiaries of the educational system.“We asked for such a report because we realized that if such families were affected by the heavy rains it meant even the students were greatly affected.“It meant they would fail to attend classes because some of the basic needs they need to prepare themselves for school were destroyed when their homes collapsed.“So the CDC went around and gave us an assessment report and the type of assistance they urgently needed. We managed to raise over K1 million which was used to purchase maize flour, salt, pails, detergent soap, plastic cup and plastic rolls of paper to cover parts of their damaged homes."He applauded the area’s Member of Parliament, who is also the country’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Dr. Emmanuel Fabiano for also supporting the Trust Fund’s initiative.“I must say Dr. Fabiano has always supported the Trust Fund’s initiative right from the start. This is an apolitical grouping comprising members of sound standing in society, whose home of origin is Chiradzulu West," said Mwapasa, who is chief executive officer for Malawi Air Cargo.Some of the Trustees include Dr. Sosten Chiotha (executive director of LEAD in Zomba); senior prominent lawyer Masauko Msungama, who is the acting chairman after the passing on of Dr. Graham Chipande (former senior and prominent lawyer in Blantyre); Executive Director for Mwachi Ltd Medson Kalambule; Communication Expert Lauren Meke Phiri and entrepreneur Kalimba.The affected number of people in whole of Chiradzulu was 65,380, according to statistics from Department of Disaster Management but the Trust Fund could only assist 100 households from T/A Mpama and T/A Chitera, who were most affected.Accompanying Mwapasa was fellow Trustee, Kalambule, who explained that the Trust Fund is the brainchild of traditional leaders from area, who sat down and asked some of the people of sound standing in society who were originally from Chiradzulu West to assist in development needs of the area.“It’s an idea that impressed all of us who were approached in order to give back to the society that raised us up to become what we are. We realized there is strength in numbers that can make a difference to our home of origin.“The traditional leaders first priority was on education because it is a strong future investment. With the help of Dr. Fabiano we set up the CDC to be identifying the needy beneficiaries themselves.“The idea is that once a needy student is selected to a secondary school, we pay for their school fees for one year in order to allow the parents to adjust and find means to take over in sustaining their children’s school needs.“But there have been many instances we have paid for the children up to their final year in secondary school because of the poverty level of their parents.“We are so happy that this Trust Fund is helping a lot of children to achieve their education dream. One day they might be on the other side and join us as one of the trustees.“We applaud all donors who have assisted this project right from the start some six years ago and we urge the potential donors to welcome us with open arms when we will come knocking at their doors in future."Another project the Fund initiated was a recreational Youth Centre that shall be equipped with a library and shall also be used for career talks, whose speakers shall be the country’s high profile professionals.Traditional leaders of the area’s visited, Village Headman Kowela and Group Village Headman Ulaya both applauded the Trustees for their gesture, saying it will help lift the morale of the affected households as they rebuild their lives Sharing is caring!

You can agree with me that within the camp, there is lack of water and sanitation and those kids need to get back to school," Katenga added.Gender Officer for Chikwawa District Council, Rita Sukasuka commended Christian Aid for looking at nutrition needs of the flood survivors currently living in camps.She said Likuni Phala is rich in all the six food groups and hoped for better improvement in the lives of the people reached with the intervention.“This helps in children’s growth. It is also quite important in lactating and pregnant mothers. We really appreciate for this unique gesture," Sukasuka said.Senior Group Village Head Kalima hailed Christian Aid for the support, calling on all other well wishers to emulate Christian Aid gesture.Christian Aid has set aside 1 million pounds (approximately K965 million) for the flood response and is expected to benefit 5,000 households, translating to 25,000 people of which 5,000 are children. Sharing is caring!

The deep low pressure system is expected to deepen to pressure value of 1004 millibars and be situated at 10.4 degrees south and 48.4 degrees east at a distance of 1670km from Nkhata Bay boma," says Nkhokwe.He says by Wednesday April 24, the deep low pressure system is expected to further deepen to pressure value of 998 millibars when its status will change to that of a tropical cyclone while situated  at 10.8 degrees south and 45.7 degrees east at a distance of 1222km from Nkhata Bay.By Thursday, Nkhokwe says, the system will be situated at 11.0 degrees south and 41.3 degrees east at 794km east of Nkhata Bay with pressure value of 996 millibars.“By Friday the system will make a landfall in Tanzania at 484km east of Nkhata Bay. By Saturday the deep low pressure will move to the Niassa Province in Mozambique to a position of 388km from Nkhata Bay," says Nkhokwe in the statement.The statement says on Wednesday, when the deep low pressure system will change its status to that of a tropical cyclone, it will be given a name of Tropical Cyclone Kenneth as per the order on the list of tropical cyclone names in the south Indian Ocean region.“Currently, the deep low pressure system has no direct effect on the weather over the Malawi. However, as the system approaches Malawi, it will enhance rainfall activities over the country particularly along the lakeshore areas," says the statement.Nkhokwe says the department is closely monitoring the movement of the deep low pressure system and its intensity which can directly or indirectly affect weather over the country and will continuously issue updates.The pending cyclone is coming after Cyclone Idai hit the southern African country in late March, barely weeks after floods affected 15 out of the country’s 28 districts and killed 60 people after displacing 868 900.The weather experts have said they are closely  monitoring movement of the pressure system and its intestoty which can directly or indirectly affect weather over the country Sharing is caring!

100	2019-03-12T11:29:08	Flood hit Mozambicans are now moving  to Malawi, especially in Nsanje where they have taken temporary shelter with Malawians in make-shift camps.Nsanje district commissioner Rengard Chavula confirmed that the district has Mozambicans who have fled their country because of flooding.“We cannot turn them away, they are in problems because of natural calamity just as we are," she said.Chavula however could not say how many have come but said they are seeking shelter in public schools along with their Malawian counterparts.She appealed for help for the desperate Mozambicans.“We are ensuring that there is adequate security in these schools so that there is no violence or  human rights abuses," said Chavula.Chavula said the Mozambicans are using the porous borders through chiefs Tengani and Mbenje areas.Chief Tengani welcomed the Mozambicans.“We cannot turn away these people, we cannot ignore them, let us assist them together with the Malawians seeking help," he said.Heavy rains and flooding have killed at least 30 people, according to official statistics.Meanwhile,  a large part of Makhanga area in Nsanje District remains inaccessible as most of access routes were still under water as of Tuesday.Streams including the Shire River flooded following continuous heavy rains in the past few days that caused damage to life and property.The situation rendered many households destitute requiring relief aid.Relief supplies meant for distribution have to be airlifted or ferried on boats to camps that have been set up, particularly on the east bank of the Shire River.In total, Nsanje has established almost 21 camps where flood victims are being accommodated. Most of these camps are primary schools.On Monday during an airborne tour of the area led by Disaster Management Affairs Department Principal Secretary, Wilson Moleni, the Malawi Defence Force helicopter that was used had to carry supplies from Bangula Trading Centre to Makhanga Primary School where the materials are further distributed to other areas of need.In an interview, Moleni told the media that access to camps on the east bank in Nsanje remains a challenge because reliable routes remain limited and expensive.“We went round the east bank and noticed that a huge area is still covered by water. People are in camps but the challenge that remains is how they can access supplies.“Tracks carrying relief items were unable to reach the cut off area. It takes the Malawi Defence Force to airlift the food from Bangula to east bank camps," Moleni said.He, however, assured people that with the progress made so far on the interventions, government was in control of the situation. – (Additional reporting by Kenneth Jali, Mana).

101	2019-01-12T10:20:20	At least 176 households in Chipasula, Kaliyeka and Kawale in Lilongwe District have been affected by what now appear to be perennial floods in the district after Chipasula River flooded following heavy rains that fell for at least two hours on Thursday.The Ministry of Homeland Security has since already come in to assist the affected households with relief items like plastic pails, blankets, plastic sheets and maize.The portfolio’s minister Nicholas Dausi visited the affected areas on Friday to appreciate the situation.“Thank God the floods occurred during the day, if it was at night, we could have lost lives," he said.He reiterated government’s call for those living and building along Chipasula and other rivers in the country to move to safer places.Witnesses said the rains started around 3 o’clock in the afternoon and fell for at least two hours. This forced Chipasula River to flood into people’s houses that have settled along the river.“As government, we will always come in when the citizens suffer. I also urge you parents not to leave children alone at home as you are going about your errands. You may find them washed away," warned the minister.A Chipasula- based 32 year old Doreen Kanyoza who had her 10 bags of cement soaked by water, some kitchen utensils and other items washed away, said it was her 12 year child that alerted her of the swelling river which is a few metres from her house.“After it had rained for about an hour, my child took an umbrella and went behind the house to relieve himself but saw that the river had swelled and water was nearing the house," she said.“We had no choice but to move to a safer place out of the house," added Kanyoza who had kept her three children away with relatives at the time of interview.She said last year, she again fell victim of the floods when the house she was living in just close by collapsed.A resident of Biwi, a location opposite Kaliyeka, John Banda said the massive flow of water in Chipasula River was so immense that several houses near it were submerged.He said the water was also flowing over the newly rehabilitated Chidzanja Bridge (others call it Kaliyeka), damaging it in the process. The bridge now looks a death trap to motorists as it has developed cracks.Another Chipasula resident, 70 year old Willam Mazoni who lives opposite Chipasula Secondary School along the road to area 23 attributed the now perennial flooding of the river to those who settled in areas government declared not habitable along the river upstream.“Lilongwe City had planted trees along the river and declared the area not habitable. But those who came to settle in such areas cut down the trees, leaving the land unprotected," said Mazoni who has stayed in the area for 16 years.He added that there was also a big drain that used to lead the run-off from upland into Chipasula River but was blocked, leaving water to flow freely along the rather small drains of the road.Mazoni, who had his house damaged, sofa set soaked and three bags of maize washed away, said water ambushed him from the back and front of his house reaching window level, but he lost none of his 16-member family.Meanwhile, councillor for Kaliyeka Ward, Richard Banda has promised to continue sensitizing those that settle along Chipasula River on dangers of such tendencies.For the past three consecutive years, Lilongwe District has not been spared with floods, mostly affecting Kawale, Chipasula, Mtandile and Kaliyeka. Sharing is caring!

The teams were deployed on 8th March 19, but until today, 26 March, they have been paid an equivalent of 7 days (K7 000) despite living in harsh conditions where they required to meet their personal needs," he said.He added that since 2012, rescue teams were being given subsistence allowancse to fend for themselves.“That’s the arrangement of allowances in 2019 is quite new and suspicious, which needs investigations by the sponsoring department  (DoDMA) or else issues of alowances should from now own be handled by DoDMA itself. The past years where payment of allowances was handled DoDMA, there were no issues of underpayment.“Junior NCOs were getting K10, 000 while senior NCOs have been getting  K15  000. On the other hand, junior officers were carting home K20, 000 and K25, 000 for senior officers. The rates above reflect subsistence allowances per rank structure," explained the source.But MDF spokesperson Paul Chiphwanya said in a brief interview on Tuesday night that his office is not aware of the development.“No! That’s news to me. I am not aware of the development," said Chiphwanya Sharing is caring!

Much as we understand that you have lost all you had but with the little assistance that you are getting you should start planning of going back and resettling."Liyati added that with the changes in climate it is expected that disaster may be here to stay as such thatgovernment and its partners should put efforts on building the capacity of citizens both economically and in knowledge so that they could be able to bounce back after disasters.Out of the 159 households that were camping at Matawa, approximately 50 had started reconstructing grass houses for them to move back to their villages.In an interview, one of the inhabitants of Matawa Camp, Lucy Nkhata 68, of KalindeVillage concurred with Liyati saying some of the houses that fell due to heavy rains in her village were too weak to withstand the rains.“I want to try and find enough resources so that I can build a house that can still stand even after getting soaked by rains for a long time," she said.A report by Phalombe District Council on the outcomes of the disaster indicated that a good population of houses fell down due to soaking alongside being washed away.Meanwhile, the Red Cross Malawi Society has assisted approximately 1,500 households in the areas of Traditional Authority (TA) Jenala and Kaduya where many people have been affected by the floods Sharing is caring!
115	2019-03-13T07:35:11	President Peter Mutharika  on Tuesday  started visiting areas affected by floods that have rendered about 114 000 people in about 10 districts in the country destitute and has assured people wthat government would do everything it could to ensure that they have all the necessary humanitarian support required.Mutharika said he was concerned with the disaster that befell the country due to heavy and continuous rains from March 5-8, 2019 resulting into loss of life, property and homes.“I know how devastating this has been to you all and I feel the pain together with you," said Mutharika. “I would like to ensure you that government will take care of all your needs and nobody is going to die of hunger while I am the president of this country," the President pointed out.He said government would strive to ensure that the displaced people were given enough support to rebuild their homes and lives.Mutharika urged the affected households not to be despondent, saying all the suffering would come to an end one day and that life would be normal again.Before his address to the people outside the camp, the Malawi leader called for a minute of silence in honour of five people, among them a man, children and women, who died in the district either due to flooding rivers or falling houses during the current disaster.According to Mangochi District Commissioner (DC), Rev.

116	2019-04-09T06:41:04	Malawi is still food secure depite natural disasters which hit the country as the crop production estimates project a 3555 000 metric tonnes (MT) maize surplus, according to figures from Ministry  of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development.Floods hit the country – following the Cyclone Idai – sweeping a lot of crops especially maize.Speaking during a news conference in Lilongwe,  Minister of Agriculture Irrigation and Water development Joseph Mwanamveka said despite the devastating floods, Malawi will still harvest 2 697 959 MT of maize.“Nevertheless, when the floods happened, crops in most affected areas  were at an advanced development stage. Hence the crops were only submerged in the waters and the loss was minimal," said Mwanamveka.Malawi government recently projected a maize surplus of 300 000 metric tonnes this year with first round crop estimates indicate that Malawi will harvest 3.3 million metric tonnes of maize in 2018/19.The harvest is up from the final estimate of 2.6 million metric tonnes in 2017/18, attributed to the Farm Input Subsidy Programme (Fisp) despite the initiative not yielding similar results in recent years.The minister said the increases were made possible due to Fisp, in particular the increase in the number of beneficiaries from 900 000 in 2017/18 to one million in the 2018/19 farming season.Mwanamveka said there is no cause for panic with the recent floods because the country is still registering the surplus maize.The minister also attributed the projected maize surplus to good rains which enabled a good crop in maize and other crops.“You may all agree with me that this season has generally been favourable  for crop production. Cumulative rainfall performance for most parts of the country has been good this season as compared to last season. Most parts of Malawi received, and continue to receive well distributed rainfall. On average, most areas received between 400-800mm of rainfall, representing average to above average rainfall amounts," he said.Agriculture is the backbone of the country’s economy and vital for the livelihoods of most Malawians, including national and household food security.The sector generates around a third of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), accounts for 65 percent of employment and wires in around 60 percent of export earnings.During the news conference, Mwanamveka announced that Malawi will harvest 112 313 metric tonnes of rice.Agriculture is also critical for Malawi’s trade. While balance of trade for agricultural products is positive, the country faces a large overall trade deficit importing more than twice its exports.While crops dominate the agricultural sector accounting for 17 percent of GDP followed by forestry at nine percent, production is concentrated on one main food crop (maize) and one main cash crop (tobacco).Maize is by far the most dominant crop grown by almost every farmer in Malawi and accounting for about 50 percent of the entire planted area.As the main source of food, maize has been at the centre of agricultural policies and public expenditures for decades. At the same time, the maize-centred approach to food security has contributed to a limited dietary diversity at household and national levels such that only 25 percent of the population are able to meet the dietary diversity Sharing is caring!
117	2019-03-12T22:53:07	The Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA) has confirmed to have recorded 45 deaths and 577 injuries as of Monday 11th March 2019 as a result of floods in some parts other country.The deparent also revealed that wo people have been reported missing.By Monday, the floods had affected about 147,958 households (approximately 739,790 people) with 15,185 households displaced.It is reported that most of the displaced families are living in camps and in their relations’ houses.So far, a total of 187 camps have been established in the affected districts.Meanwhile, there is an ongoing assessments to establish the extent of damage in all the 14 affected districts.DoDMA has since admitted that due to heavy flooding of many areas in the Lower Shire, it is becoming a nightmare to reach most of the affected communities by roads.However, DoDMA together with various humanitarian partners is working tirelessly to reach out to all affected people with relief items and social services, at all costs.Choppers are being used in the Lower Shire to ferry relief items in hard-to-reach areas, as well as ferrying the sick from hard to reach areas for medical attention in nearby health facilities.On Friday, Malawian President Peter Mutharika declared a State of Emergency in the areas hit hardest by the rains and flooding, which followed the formation of a “tropical disturbance" over the Mozambique Channel earlier in the week.Mutharika directed emergency relief services to be coordinated immediately and also ordered Malawi’s army to assist those trapped and displaced.The World Food Programme (WFP) has deployed two boats to accompany the assessment and response; the UN Childrens’ Fund (UNICEF) is providing drones; and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), in collaboration with the WFP, is supporting mapping using satellite imagery Sharing is caring!
118	2019-02-07T14:09:45	Principal Secretary for the Ministry of Homeland Security, Sam Madula has faulted Malawians building in disaster-prone areas, saying their resistance to move to safer grounds costs the country unnecessary loss of lives and property.Madula made the assertion recently in Mangochi at the opening of a five – day disaster resilience leadership training for directors and senior officers from various government ministries, departments and agencies.He said one of the reasons the country continues to register disasters caused by floods and other adverse weather conditions is because some people in the country were adamant and do not heed caution.“The culture of resistance is becoming a big challenge that is costing government a lot of money as people do not heed advice; why should we have floods damaging houses and people’s property in the same places every year?" wondered Madula.“We have people building houses on top of Soche Hill in Blantyre; we have people building right in the river course in Mtandire, Lilongwe and some who refuse to move to upland down in Lower Shire – yet, when disaster strikes it is government that bears the brunt of ensuring that the affected people are assisted," said Madula.Madula, therefore, called upon traditional and religious leaders and non – governmental organizations to join government’s efforts in sensitizing people to avoid settling in disaster-prone areas.He also urged the media fraternity to sensitize the public through both electronic and print to keep people away from avoidable disaster that may cost lives and property.The five-day training is being facilitated by experts from Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre (ADPC), a regional non-profit making foundation based in Bangkok, Thailand and deals with building resilience of people and institutions affected by disasters.ADPC Deputy Executive Director, Aslam Perwais said in an interview with Malawi News Agency (Mana) that his team was ready to equip government senior officers with the technical know-how on disaster preparedness.“In Malawi you have a vibrant human resource base and what’s required is to build its capacity and activate it for action," said Perwais, adding that the training would also help government report well on disaster issues.The training follows the post-disaster assessment that the World Bank conducted following the 2015 floods which displaced over 230,000 people and left at least 175 people dead.The assessment identified gaps, which according to the World Bank’s Senior Disaster Risk Management Specialist, Francis Mkoka, include need for training of all structures that deal with disasters from the top to the ground.“These trainings will continue. Some will even be longer and we want the knowledge to cascade down to the civil protection committees dealing with disasters at community level," Mkoka said.Mkoka added that after training senior government officers, the ADPC experts would also train technicians from all government ministries, departments and agencies before taking the training to the academia where short courses on the subject matter will be introduced Sharing is caring!
119	2019-03-13T06:49:49	The Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC) has admitted that being an elections period, floods occurring in some parts of the the country have greatly affected its operations.The development has therefore forced the Commission to reschedule the dates for holding the vetting exercise in the affected councils.A statement released on Tuesday revealed that the exercise failed to take place in three districts.“The Commission failed to conduct ballot paper vetting exercise in Mwanza, Chikwawa and Nsanje because candidates could not manage to travel from their various places to  the council offices," the statement reads.Considering the fact that the floods have displaced many people and  damaged their household items, the commission acknowledges that some people have lost their voter certificates during the disaster.But the commission has assured all affected Malawians that this could not be a cause for worry as they will still be able to cast their votes.“The Commission would like  to assure all of them that they will be able to vote without a voter certificate as long as they registered as voters.“The Commission will also be working closely with all councils to establish whether infrastructures designated as voting centres have been damaged by the floods" reads part of the statement.MEC has further promised to provide tents for shelter during voting to the flood affected areas.Meanwhile, as a way of averting the impact of climate change, the Commission is joining all stakeholders in calling on the general public to avoid deforestration and has since strongly encouraged the general public to plant more trees in their communities Sharing is caring!
120	2019-02-19T05:16:41	The Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services (DCCMS) says most areas across the country’s regions are likely to experience a wave of scattered to widespread rains with thunderstorms starting from the south, Monday 18, which would progress northwards for the rest of the week days.In a statement issued on Sunday, Director of DCCMS, Jolamu Nkhokwe said the rains would be locally heavy over the southern and central regions.“This is due to the passage of Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone boosted by heating during sunny intervals and lifting of airflow over high ground.“A significant reduction of rainfall activities is expected to follow on Friday over the south," he stated.Nkhokwe said the expected rainfall would cause localized disruption of outdoor activities across the country.“People are therefore advised to continue taking preventive measures such as being indoors, avoiding playing on an open ground, seeking shelter under trees, moving in rains and physical interaction with electrical appliances whenever thunderstorms occur within the vicinity to avoid being struck by lightning and being electrocuted.“Motorists, particularly on earth roads should slow down at the sign of rain as the road surfaces become more muddy and slippery due to loss of friction during and after rainfall. At night and morning hours, they should exercise caution due to reduced visibility caused by the occurrence of fog in prone areas," Nkhokwe said.Nkhokwe added that with climate change, disasters such as floods and dry spells due to heavy and lack of rainfall respectively, are now becoming most frequent and wide-spread in the country.“The public is thus encouraged to plant and manage more trees to enhance reduction of future disasters and preserve soil.“The grown trees will later act as wind breaks during strong winds. Also, the trees will help in bringing more rain by adding more moisture to the already existing moisture in the atmosphere," he said.Nkhokwe said DCCMS was closely monitoring weather developments including tropical cyclone formation in the Indian Ocean which could directly or indirectly affect weather over the country Sharing is caring!
121	2019-01-22T11:31:56	Weather experts are warning of severely weather in most parts in the southern region which will lead to heavy flooding in some areas.Director of Climate Change and Meteorological Department Jolam Nkhokwe has said continuous rains are expected in the south from today, Tuesday.“This will cause heavy flooding. This is so because the soil is soft because we are coming from another continuous two week rains," he said.Nkhokwe therefore asked people to move upland, saying low lying areas can be devastating and asked people to avoid crossing flooded rivers.This is a third warning since the onset of the rainy season December.Nkhokwe said heavy rains accompanied by strong winds are expected  due to a deep and wide low pressure system in the Mozambique Channel which has strengthened and therefore been named Tropical storm ‘Desmond’ while located near Quelimane north of Beira in Mozambique, which is 390 kilometres away from southern Malawi border in Nsanje.“By 14:00 hours on Monday, January 21, 2019, the Tropical Storm was on its way to make a landfall over Mozambique, while dumping heavy rains overland including southern Malawi. The storm is expected to weaken by Wednesday, January 23, 2019," he stated.Nkhokwe cautioned that the anticipated heavy rains could cause floods including flash floods in prone areas.“We are appealing to the public to secure their property and lives as well as take precautionary measures like  moving to higher grounds when water levels have started rising.“They should also avoid crossing flooding rivers and must not seek shelter under trees and weak infrastructures," he added Sharing is caring!
122	2019-01-18T05:41:41	Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services has said the recent floods which wrecked havoc in Lilongwe can be attributed to human activities which could be avoided.Chief Agriculture Meteorologist, Adams Chavula said the recent floods which occurred in Mchesi, Kawale and Chipasula in Lilongwe were man-made and that the city council could be blamed for not taking preventive measures before hand.Chavula, therefore, advised all city and district councils to take preventive measures like abiding by by-laws when allocating land to citizens to avoid recurrence of disasters.“Lilongwe City Council, other cities and district councils should strive to have good drainage systems to avoid recurrence of floods like those that were recently experienced in Lilongwe," he said.Earlier this month, there were floods in Lilongwe.According to the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA), Area 47, Kawale and Mchesi were among the most affected areas where a number of people were affected leaving some homeless and without food.“Our land has been highly affected by man’s own making, there is environmental degradation and what makes it more complicated is the issue of poor drainage systems.“Our city and district councils are doing less to ensure there are better drainage systems around cities and our communities," Chavula said.He said the meteorological department has evaluated the Lilongwe floods and established that the floods occurred due to poor drainage systems in the city, environmental degradation and the city council’s failure to allocate proper land to its residents, among other factors.“I would like to advise the city and district councils in the country to make sure they construct good drainage systems in their various cities and districts besides civic educating the citizens about the dangers of environmental degradation and its impact on the economy.“Local councils also need to abide by land by-laws when allocating land. People should avoid building houses along the river banks," Chavula said.He observed that if it were not for environmental degradation and poor drainage systems, the Lilongwe floods could have been avoided.Recently, a resident of Chipasula, 70 year old William Mazoni who was affected by the recent floods told Mana people had cut the trees that Lilongwe City Council planted along some parts of Chipasula River and had settled in places the city declared not habitable Sharing is caring!
123	2019-03-13T10:41:52	Malawi Congress Party (MCP) presidential running mate in the 21 May 2019 watershed election, Sidik Mia —renowned for his charity work –  has now gone flat out to help people who have been adversely affected by floods in Shire Valley.“The floods this year caught us (Malawi) off-guard. However, on our part as Sidik Mia Foundation, our charity machinery has been activated and we have started giving help to those who have been affected.“I will visit four affected areas here in Chikwawa and later in the afternoon, I will descend to Nsanje for the same exercise," said Mia at Kulima village in Chikwawa—the first place for the exercise where he distributed maize flour (Ufa) and cow peas to the affected people.Quizzed if he is doing it out of politics, Mia said helping people is his way of life.“Are you a stranger in Shire Valley and in our country," queried Mia adding “charity is part of my life. It is in my DNA and this is why we have Sidik Mia Foundation…it is a charitable organization."Politically, state controlled Malawi Broadcasting Corporation (MBC TV) in its bulletin news  carried comments from Lyson Sibande, a pro-government commentator who  attacked the opposition MCP and  Mia for holding celebrations, referring to the launch of the party Manifesto in Lilongwe, over the weekend.According to Sibande, MCP and Mia were insensitive to hold the Manifesto launch when a cross section of the people were affected by floods.Mia downplayed the accusation as cheap political propaganda.“Information about the extent of the damage was trickling in on the eve and during the launch of our Manifesto such that our president, Dr Lazarus Chakwera, directed during the Manifesto launch that we fundraise to help those affected by the floods. Over 5 million kwacha was realized—within minutes—following that plea on that day, is this what they are calling being “insensitive" to the plight of flood victims?" countered Mia.Mia said MCP is now “focused, organized and united" to win the May 21 watershed election Sharing is caring!
124	2019-01-12T15:16:44	Minister of Transport and Public Works, Jappie Mhango, has said is dissappointed with compromised quality over the Mchesi Bridge in the capital Lilongwe that got washed away by heavy rains two days ago.Mhango, who toured the place on Friday, said the new bridge is very far from reaching its life span.According to Mhango, government will have to question the contractor on why it came up with shoddy work.“We can’t afford to compromise quality. We will have to take the contractor to task for poor workmanship. This is taxpayers’ money, and it has to be seriously accounted for," said Mhango.Nyasa Times understands that Sawa Group—one of the companies that have received numerous construction projects—was contracted to do the job.Mhango said his ministry will go around the country to check construction projects that are not up to it.“Where some of these projects are failing we will have to revise for purposes of re-awarding other contracts in the future," he said.A heavy downpour that lasted three hours wrecked havoc in  some parts of Lilongwe such as Biwi, Kawale, Area 36, Kaliyeka and Chipasula.An assessment by the department of disasters and preparedness indicates that at least two people are missing and that 176 households have been affected.Minister of Homeland Security, Nicholas Dausi, visited the areas and pledged speedy support from government.Sawa Group, a company which has connections to the corridors of power, constructed the multi-million bridge which only lasted a few months and got washed away during the flooding.“The works were shoddy. When we hire a contractor, we expect high standards, we expect high quality work within the specified period and budget," said Mhango.He said this was not the case with the Kawale-Mchesi bridge, saying the contractor will have to work on it again.“The advantage is that we are in a period when the contractor is responsible for what happens to the bridge," said Mhango.Some Malawians on social media are blaming the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for shoddy construction works on most projects as the party wants to deliver its campaign promises of 2014 before the May 21 highly contentious tripartite elections which are due in just three months’ time Sharing is caring!
125	2019-03-24T00:12:46	President  Peter Mutharika has promised Malawians that government would construct more dykes in flood prone areas to avoid reoccurrence of disasters.He was speaking on Saturday at Nyambadwe Primary School ground when he donated various items to people affected by disaster.Mutharika said the recent floods were as a result of climate change, hence the need for more and long lasting dykes.“Since the floods occurred, my government has been looking for a solution to end such effects of climate change and one such idea is the construction of dykes across the districts to avoid a repeat of such incidents," the President said.He commended the South African government which  has deployed a 25-member medical team to support Malawi in treating people affected by floods.The team arrived on Saturday through Chileka International Airport in Blantyre and has so far treated people in Chikwawa District, one of the worst hit.The team is also transporting humanitarian support to hard-to-reach areas using their helicopter.Mutharika expressed his gratitude towards the Chinese and American Government for the support rendered to Malawi in supporting affected households.The President said government would continue rendering more support to all flood victims in the country, citing relief food that will be distributed in the next three months until people recover from the tragedy.“I and the First Lady, we will donate our personal money and 1, 000 blankets to some flood victims any day from today," he promised adding that, “In fact, the consignment has already arrived at Sanjika Palace."Mutharika assured affected households that government would ensure that all those who were left homeless with the floods benefit from the Decent and Affordable Housing Subsidy Programme popularly known as Malata and Cement Subsidy.The Malawi leader  sent his heartfelt condolences to families who have lost their loved ones in the recent road accident which happened at Linthipe in Dedza on Saturday as well as at Kampepuza open market in Ntcheu on Friday by ordering a minute of silence in honour of the departed souls.One of the floods survives in Ndirande, who lost a child; Maria Chikaphonya thanked the President and the First Lady for their support. Blantyre City Council Chief Executive Officer, Alfred Chanza said more than 52, 000 people have been affected in Blantyre City alone. Among the items donated by the President in Ndirande included rice, blankets, maize flour, buckets, salt and plastic sheets.President Mutharika declared a State of National Disaster following the disaster that hit hard 15 of the country’s 28 districts and killed 56 people in the country.

126	2019-03-17T10:13:23	President Peter Mutharika has reaffirmed government’s commitment to ensuring that all people displaced by devastating rains return to their normal life and continue with their routine activities for their livelihood improvement.Mutharika was speaking on Saturday at Mileme Primary School evacuation camp in the area of Traditional Authority Jenala in Phalombe when he visited and cheered households displaced by floods following the continuous rains experienced last week.He said government remains committed to improve people’s living conditions including those affected by natural disasters by instituting various social protection programmes such as enlisting affected households in public works and social cash transfer programmes, among others.“We will do everything possible to ensure lives of people that have been affected by the floods return to normal," Mutharika said.Mutharika said he has since directed the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development to take on board all people whose houses were destroyed by the disaster under the Decent and Affordable Housing Subsidy Programme, popularly known as the Cement and Malata Subsidy.The president, however, asked people to render support to people affected by the floods with the little available resources in community in the spirit of patriotism considering that Malawi was well known as the Warm Heart of Africa.He deplored gender based violence which is mostly perpetrated by men.On killings and abductions of people with albinism, Mutharika said government is determined to deal with the problem once and for all, saying the United Nations had deployed a team of experts to assist in investigating the issue, besides instituting a Commission of Enquiry.“Government is doing its best to come to the bottom of the problem. The commission that we’ve swore-in this week is composed of highly respected people headed by a Judge of the Supreme Court of Appeal," he said.“But there are some misguided people who are busy undermining government efforts to deal with the problem," he said. “We should take politics out of the issue of albinos."The Malawian leader, therefore, thanked the governments of South Africa and America for responding to government’s call immediately when the disaster was declared a state of emergency.“The US Government has supported Malawi in its humanitarian efforts with K146 million while South Africa has sent a team of rescue experts. This kind of bilateral cooperation needs to be commended," he added.District Commissioner for Phalombe, Memory Kaleso said the disaster left one child dead and 18 others injured with most of the affected losing household property, including food.However, Kaleso said the council was grateful to Malawi Red Cross Society and Sawa Group, the Indian Community and Bilal Trust for responding swiftly to the call by government on the emergency.“Classes have been disrupted because; either the children have lost their learning materials to the floods or classrooms have been occupied by people displaced by the same," Kaleso said.At least 21, 870 households representing 96, 026 people have been affected by the floods in Phalombe district alone.Traditional Authority Jenala said the displaced people were living in deplorable conditions with sanitation and hygiene compromised. He said the stormy rains have also destroyed crops thereby increasing people’s vulnerability to hunger.He described Mutharika as a considerate and passionate leader, noting that by cutting short his official visit to the north was clear demonstration of his concern for the welfare of all Malawians Sharing is caring!
127	2019-03-15T11:30:11	President  Peter Mutharika has said the the Decent and Affordable Housing (Cement and Malata) Subsidy Programme (DAHSP)  will consider every household affected by the recent disaster in the affected 10 districts.Mutharika said this Thursday at Namatamba Primary School in Traditional Authority Mwambo in Zomba district where he cheered and interacted with victims of persistent rains that destroyed houses in the area.The Malawi leader said the program will provide cement and iron sheets to the affected households to ensure they are able to rebuild their houses in time.He  then warned Malawians against killing people with albinism, saying it was inhuman.Mutharika  added that government had out-sourced services of experts to investigate the issue thoroughly so that it is brought to an end forthwith.Speaking earlier, Minister of Homeland Security, Nicholas Dausi said government has an obligation to rush to the assistance of its citizenry in time with relief items.He said that was the reason the President decided to cut short his official government business in the north the moment he heard that Southern Region was experiencing persistent rains.Dausi then condemned opposition political parties for concentrating on politics in time of disaster like the one the southern region experienced.The recent disaster has resulted in Zomba District council commissioning 54 evacuation centres where 3,571 families are being sheltered.According to the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA), as of Tuesday, March 12, 2019, 56 deaths and 577 injuries were recorded. Three people were missing.Zomba alone recorded four deaths in Traditional Authority Chikowi and two from Traditional Authority Malemia.During the function, President Mutharika made a symbolic presentation of relief items to some of the affected people.The State President has already visited Balaka, Mangochi and Machinga where he cheered and interacted with victims of the heavy and destructive rains Sharing is caring!

Not only that but also the Social Cash Transfer to reach out to the most affected families so that they have something in hand for the period they are rebuilding their lives," he said.The President said that he understood that some people died while others lost property when the disasters happened and told the people who gathered at Chikuse camp that his government would try its best to help them all.“In areas where need be, we will construct dykes so that we don’t have this problem again. Let me assure you that nobody will die of hunger as a result of the floods," he added.Mutharika said his government would continue providing necessary support to all the affected people.Paramount Chief Lundu said the disasters affected almost each and every Traditional Authority (TA) in the district.He hailed President Mutharika for postponing the programmes he was supposed to carry out in the north saying such a gesture expressed the solidarity the President has with the disaster victims.“While other people were busy dining and having wine in the capital Lilongwe when the disasters struck, you called off all your official duties to be with the affected families.“Your presence today has brought joy and happiness in these people. We also appreciate your usual support especially with the relief items you have brought to the people," Lundu pointed out.He said people in the camps needed more support that includes medication for fear of some waterborne diseases and malaria Sharing is caring!
129	2019-03-19T10:43:46	President Peter Mutharika has warned of tough action against those who will be found involved in stealing relief items meant for disaster victims.The President sounded the warning on Monday when he visited flood victims currently staying at Chikuse Camp around Nchalo in Chikwawa District.Mutharika said he was aware that some ill-minded people were busy stealing and hiding relief items meant for the flood victims, saying severe action would be taken on them.“Let me warn all of you who are trying to steal from the disaster-affected people. I know some people are busy hiding the relief items while others are putting their relations on the beneficiary list.“Let me tell you, that is bad and you will be punished for that. I will pin you down and serve a six-month jail term," said Mutharika.The President then called on all the affected families not to lose hope but have faith in government and God that all was well.Minister of Homeland Security, Honourable Nicholas Dausi urged chiefs to seriously conduct the distribution of relief items with transparency and accountability.“The President has ensured that each and every affected household gets assisted. May I request other nongovernmental organizations and other political parties to come together, this is the time when a lot of people need our help," said Dausi.On his part, Chikwawa District Commissioner, Lusizi Nhlane said the heavy rains that poured between March 5 and 10 March left scores of people stranded in the district.He said 53, 765 people were affected translating to 12, 755 households.“There are 56 child headed households in the camps, 5,210 female headed with 7,488 male headed households.“Chikwawa district has so far opened 34 camps for the disaster victims.

Four complicated cases have, so far, been reported. Health facilities are far from each other and the flooded roads are impassable to access health care services.United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is working with district health offices to distribute condoms to the camps.“UNFPA is also working with the Ministry of Health and Population- Reproductive Health Directorate to facilitate a comprehensive assessment of the capacity of health facilities to provide safe deliveries. This assessment will start as early as next week," the report reads in part.The report says health workers have also been displaced, creating a situation of non-availability of staff to provide services.Apparently, the report says disease surveillance was strengthened by training 300 health workers out of the targeted 600 deployed to Phalombe, Balaka, Blantyre, Machinga, Mangochi and Chikwawa districts.Ministry of Health has, so far, distributed 107,500 mosquito nets to the camps from the surplus of the 2018 Mass Net Distribution Campaign.At least 15 districts were affected by the floods rendering about 868,895 destitute and 173 camps have been created to house the victims.A vibrant writer who gives a great insight on hot topics and issuesExpect more floods—Met.

Most of the displaced families are living in camps and their relations’ houses. So far, a total of 187 camps have been established in the affected districts," reads Dodma’s official facebook page Tuesday.Dodma spokesperson, Chipiliro Khamula, said they have distributed relief items to all the hard-to-reach areas affected by floods, especially in Lower Shire districts of Nsanje and Chikwawa.Nsanje District Commissioner, Reinghard Chavula, on Monday said many houses have collapsed and two deaths were reported in Makhanga area.“We have received a lot of support in form of food, blankets, plastic sheets and pales. We are thankful to the government," she said.Village Head Kalonga recalled that such devastating floods occurred in 2015 but her subjects could not move upland because the government has not allocated them a proper land for resettlement.“People just talk…No , the government has not allocated us resettlement place (up land). But we need to protect the lives of these children," he said.United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) has also provided assistance to the affected areas, ensuring that primary and secondary school classes resume in areas affected by the floods.In a press release issued on March 11 2019, Unicef Public Relations Officer, Rebecca Phwitiko, says they would provide tents and school supplies to schools and temporary learning centres and deploy additional volunteer teachers to the affected areas.“With thousands forced out of their flooded homes, many families lack basic supplies including food, water and sanitation facilities.

133	2019-01-23T10:50:33	By Jameson Chauluka: Malawi is likely to experience more floods in the next few days, especially in the flood-prone areas of the Southern Region, the Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services has warned.“The anticipated heavy rains could cause floods, including flush floods in prone areas. Therefore, to secure lives and property, the public should take precautionary measures such as moving to higher grounds when water levels start rising, avoid crossing flooding rivers and not seeking shelter under trees and weak structures," reads a statement from the department.The statement says the adverse weather conditions are due to deep and wide low pressure systems in the Mozambican channel that has been strengthened some 390 kilometers North of the Southern border of Malawi and Mozambique in Nsanje District.It says, because of the storm, from Monday to today, heavy rains, accompanied by strong winds, are expected mainly in the Southern Region.“By 14:00 hours on Monday January 21st, the tropical storm was on its way to make a landfall over Mozambique, while dumping heavy rains overland including [in] Southern Malawi," the statement reads in part.So far, 21 people have died due to natural disasters in the last six months in Malawi, with most of the deaths being due to lightning, which the department linked to deforestation.Severe weather conditions are, however, expected to weaken later this week in the Southern Region.A vibrant writer who gives a great insight on hot topics and issuesFloods threaten food security—Fao.
134	2019-03-20T10:25:56	By Feston Malekezo:The food security situation is expected to worsen due to floods in the Southern Region which produces about one-third of Malawi’s maize output, Food and Agriculture Organisation’s (Fao) food security snapshot warns.The report, published on Monday, indicates that although there is no official data regarding the impact of the floods on the agriculture sector, crop losses are expected in the worst affected areas.Production of maize, Malawi’s main food staple, was forecast to increase to above average of about 3.3 million tonnes in 2019.The principal factor that supported the favourable production outlook is beneficial rainfall since the start of the cropping season in October 2018.“The recent floods in the Southern Region, which have affected over 900,000 people, have further compounded the situation. Losses of food supplies, damages to the soon-to-be harvested 2019 crops and reduced access to markets are likely to aggravate food security conditions.“Heavy rainfall, forecast for much of the second half of March, could increase the risk of further flooding, potentially resulting in larger crop losses and interruptions to humanitarian operations," the report reads in part.The report says in the Central and Northern districts, there is a likelihood of an increase in cereal production, which is expected to foster improvements in food security in 2019 compared to 2018.“Following a tight maize supply situation in the 2018/19 marketing year, April and March, due to a sharply reduced harvest, prospects for 2019/20 are more favourable resting on the likely increase in production. The forecast supply upturn is expected to enable a build-up in stocks for both households and national strategic reserves, while import requirements are foreseen to fall and remain at below average levels," the short report reads further.According to Fao, prices of maize increased steeply since the last quarter of 2018, with seasonal trends exacerbated by a tighter-than-normal supply situation.As a result, prices of maize in January 2019 were more than one-third above their year-earlier levels and, in areas such as, Mzuzu, doubled.“In the southern districts, the recent impact of the floods could result in temporary price spikes, due to disruptions to the food supply chain. Looking further ahead, if the above average production in 2019 occurs, maize prices are expected to come under downward pressure in 2019 following the main harvest that is expected to begin late April," the reports notes.Irrigation and Water Development Ministry spokesperson, Hamilton Chimala, Tuesday said no Malawian would die of hunger as promised by President Peter Mutharika.“We shall be releasing a statement next week. Currently, we are consolidating effects of the flooding and incessant rainfall on crop stand, livestock, infrastructure, fisheries, among others. So, we are going to provide steps which the government will take to address the emerging gaps," he said.A vibrant writer who gives a great insight on hot topics and issuesHouse collapses, 2 people die.

Whenever the area floods, they should be in those safety homes, living with dignity and not in these camps," he said.During the visit, Chakwera donated maize flour and pigeon peas to over 2,000 affected families in the two camps.“This is what we have bought with contributions which members of the party made but whatever the government is going to bring is what would be bought with the tax payers’ money," he said.A vibrant writer who gives a great insight on hot topics and issuesSchools bear floods burden.
137	2019-03-29T12:32:39	The calamity which has befallen the country due to floods caused by heavy rains has affected every sector in the country. Most of the victims are seeking refuge in school blocks. But in providing such a temporary solution to the perennial problem, EMMANUEL CHIRWA has, in this Friday Shaker, established that another problem is being created—that of violeting learners’ right to education.It started with heavy rains which fell unceasingly. On March 6 2019 in the evening, a horde of villagers started off on a 16-kilometre journey to Mchenga Primary School at Ngabu in Chikwawa District.The people camped on the veranda of some classrooms at the school. They were from Traditional Authority Makhuwira in the district.Their property, including houses, had just been washed away by an overflowing Shire River. Authorities gave the villagers two classrooms to spend the night in.The next day, more people—some from as far as Group Village Head Gumbala, Nsanje District; which is on the other side of the river—sought refuge at the school.To reach the school, the villagers had to cross the flooded Shire on canoes and other vessels improvised from tree barks. Come March 9, the school was home to 1,500 people.School authorities had no choice but to accommodate the helpless people.Such was the level of desperation—the classroom’s status shifting from that of hostel at night to learning area during the day.But such goodwill had its repercussions, the school’s head teacher, Kapito Clemence, noted.“During daytime, the campers stay at the school ground with their belongings to give room to learners but, when rains come, we interrupt lessons and put learners of various grades in one classroom to accommodate the campers," Clemence said.The school is now home to 2,000 people who share 15 toilets, thereby posing a health risk to learners as some people shun toilets.Mchenga School is not alone in this situation. Khulubvi Primary School in Thondwe, Zomba the and countless others have also been affected by the floods.Khulubvi Primary School Head teacher, Luciano Chikalimba, admitted that floods have affected teaching and learning at the school.“We conduct lessons under a tree because some of the classrooms are occupied by people affected by heavy rains. Our classes are so big that they cannot be manned by one teacher. We split them into A and B but, under the circumstances, we are forced to combine them, making it difficult to effectively deliver lessons," he said.Chikalimba said children who are incapable of using toilets defecate in the open. This poses a health hazard to the school.Health officers distributed chemicals and gloves for use in cleaning but teaching and learning remain a challenge at the school.In the long run, such an environment undermines delivery of quality education.“Our fear is that learners are not concentrating enough when we teach them. Most get distracted while learning. Moreover, the presence of many people and other activities at the school puts off some of the learners," Chikalimba said.Clemence said the environment prevents them from meeting the needs of each learner while some learners shun classes altogether.The Department of Disaster Management Affairs (Dodma) indicates that the country has 173 evacuation centres that accommodate victims of floods. Most of these centres are primary school rooms.Civil Society Education Coalition Executive Director, Benedicto Kondowe, said the schools that are accommodating victims are not conducive to learning.He said, as the nation is helping floods victims, it is also violating other people’s rights.“Right to education is fundamental and needs not be infringed on. We understand that the situation which the disasters have, for ages, been causing is unbearable but we ought to see to it that the right to education is not violated. When learners fail to learn because school blocks are accommodating people who have been affected by floods, this violates the learners’ right to education," Kondowe said.Kondowe said it was high time the government and all stakeholders found long-lasting solutions to the problem of people affected by disasters lodging in schools.He said lodging in schools should be the last resort and a temporary measure.“Problems of disasters, especially those related to floods, are perennial in Malawi. What differs is just the magnitude. That being the case, the government and stakeholders should be vigilant in addressing these problems. There is need for construction of more shelters to house those affected by disasters instead of accommodating them in school," Kondowe said.He said people that stay in flood-prone areas should adhere to the government’s call to relocate upland.He said doing so would keep the children, whose education gets disrupted in the course of running away from floods, t in school.But Education, Science and Technology Ministry’s spokesperson, Lindiwe Chide, said they have put in place measures to ensure that school lessons are not disrupted whenever floods hit the country.Chide said her ministry has collaborated with Dodma in distributing tents to schools that are accommodating flood victims.“We are distributing tents which will either be used for lessons or lodging by people affected by floods—depending on each school management’s decision," she said.Chide said the ministry had dispatched 48 tents to schools and more are expected to be sent to all affected schools.Chide said they were not only responding to needs of schools that are accommodating flood victims but also those that had lost teaching and learning materials to the floods.“We are also sending education boxes which have textbooks and exercise books for schools and learners that have lost stationery materials to the floods," she said.Dodma and the Ministry of Education are working hand-in-hand to distribute tents to the affected schools.Principal Secretary and Dodma Commissioner, Wilson Moleni, said some districts have received tents and the exercise is on-going.“We have distributed tents to some districts, such as Phalombe and Mulanje, to mention a few, and the exercise is on-going. We will ensure that we reach each and every centre, including areas where classes have been disrupted," he said.“Our plan is that the government, in collaboration with international non-governmental organisations, should build more evacuation centres. Places where these structures will be erected have been earmarked. Once the project is done, the issue of flood victims being accommodated in schools will be a tale of the past," he said.But, as of now, schools are bearing the brunt of floods.A vibrant writer who gives a great insight on hot topics and issues
